---

### A working implementation of Huffman coding algorithm that can compress files concurrently using Go's coroutine. Currently it supports compressing only alphabets(both upper and lower case)

### Comparison of example.txt file before and after compression

- _Original Size_ -> **22k**

- _Size after compression_ -> **4.7k**
